# Machine Learning Project for Drug Response Prediction in Cancer
This project was carried out in a team of three for the McGill classes ECSE456: Design Project 1 and ECSE457: Design Project 2.

The goal of the project was to use cancer cell line data to train machine learning models that predict drug response in cancer patients, and then identify the machine learning model that yielded the best ultimate performance on the test set. We trained various models ranging from simple single-task linear models to more complex models such as neural networks and network-guided multi-task models. Our best model yielded a performance of 5/13 drugs for which drug response was found to be statistically significant.
